                <p class="mt-3 answer">CureMD AI Scribe is more than just medical dictation software or an AI
                    medical
                    notetaker; it's a comprehensive doctor's note automation tool that automates both clinical
                    documentation and order management. Unlike other solutions, it filters out extraneous
                    information, generates codified SOAP notes directly in your EHR, and fills in applicable ICD-10
                    and DDID codes. It also automatically sends out orders once the note is signed. This produces
                    accurate voice-to-text medical notes, automated orders, saves time, reduces cognitive burden,
                    and allows you to focus more on patient care.</p>
